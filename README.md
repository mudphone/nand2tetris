# What is this?
I've used [LFE](http://lfe.io) and [Elixir](http://lfe.io) (and other tools) to follow the Nand2Tetris course, which guides "self-learners through the construction of a modern, full-scale computer system - hardware and software - from the ground up. In the process, the students practice many major computer science (CS) abstractions studied in typical CS courses and make them concrete through 12 guided implementation projects."

## The Overview Video
[From Nand to Tetris In 12 Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtXvUoPx4Qs) [~9 minutes]
